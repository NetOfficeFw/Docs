# Use latest NetOfficeFw packages

By using **NetOfficeFw** packages you will get our latest NetOffice libraries. Our packages are
digitally signed and their source code is available.

Official packages have new features, several bugfixes and have great debugging experience.

To upgrade existing projects which use the old **NetOffice.*** packages from NuGet (eg. **NetOffice.Word**, **NetOffice.Excel**, **NetOffice.Outlook** and others),
you must manually uninstall these packages and get the new equivalent versions named **NetOfficeFw.***.

Our [official NetOffice release](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/netoffice) is **1.8.1** (as of February 2021).


## Move away from old packages

We noticed a rogue account named *netofficedotnet* published NetOffice on NuGet in releases 1.7.4.4 and 1.7.4.11.
Those packages contain old NetOffice libraries which does not work correctly.
Please, check your projects for any packages published by *netofficedotnet* or by *Erika LeBlanc*.

Use this guide to migrate to official NetOfficeFw packages.

### Use Package Manager Console to migrate packages

You can use **Package Manager** in **Visual Studio** to migrate to new packages
by using these commands (sample for Word package):

```
PM> Uninstall-Package NetOffice.Word
PM> Uninstall-Package NetOffice.Core
PM> Install-Package NetOfficeFw.Word
```

### Use NuGet Package Manager to migrate packages

To migrate to **NetOfficeFw** packages from Visual Studio user interface,
use NuGet Package Manager.

1. Right click on you project and choose **Manage NuGet Packages...**
0. Open **Installed** tab
0. Select your installed **NetOffice** packages
0. Click **Uninstall** button
0. Open **Browse** tab
0. Enter **netofficefw** into search box
0. Select the packages based on the MS Office application you develop for
0. Click **Install** button

> *Note:* Please, make sure you uninstall all existing NetOffice.* packages, including **NetOffice.Core**
to prevent issues in the application caused by referencing NetOffice libraries twice and
with different versions.
